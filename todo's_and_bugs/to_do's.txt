big things to do : 
    update the fixuture and stake components with conditional live rendering for the case of live data
        this will mean also updating the redux store for the matches to match this new live design
    redesign and build the profile to match the new design for this project
    finish building the stakes showcase page to completion: 
        make the rendering of the status conditional with lost, won, live and pending as options
        give the page a redesing with AI

small things to do that im not lazy to do for now : 
     find the way the payloads should be placed on the requests for fetching data using get requests


code red things that need to be done as soon as possible: 
    buld the success card component for the stake linking page
    fix the fixture card rendering thing , make the filtering universal so that we can filter easily by anything
